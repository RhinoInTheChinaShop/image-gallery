Image Gallery
=============

A JavaScript based (with PHP backend) image gallery made for large numbers of images

The gallery is made to be a standalone application, with methods for dealing with users, multiple layers of organization for pictures, and more features.

## About the Gallery
The inspiration for the gallery came from seeing too many services using galleries that had no way of dealing with many images-  
the galleries only had two levels of organization: pictures inside albums.

I (Ryan) realized I had to code my own solution after taking over 1200 pictures at one family event, there had to be a better way than requiring people to balance the number of pictures and making it easy for people to browse the images.

The organization is simple, and I (Ryan) think it will work well for most people.  As I often hold the shutter down to capture multiple shots of a single subject, the foundation of the organization is pictures added to *shots*, where the best picture is highlighted, but you can see all of the images rejected.  The shots are organized by *sets*, for sub-groups in an event.  Each set is part of a *day*, so multi-day events can be quickly sorted to see the progress.  Days come together in *events*, which is the primary sorting method.
